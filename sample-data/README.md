# SwarmID Sample Data

This directory contains realistic sample data for testing the SwarmID system with different types of network traffic and security events.

## üìÅ Data Types

### 1. Zeek Connection Logs
- **File**: `zeek-conn.log`
- **Format**: Tab-separated values (TSV)
- **Content**: Network connection metadata from Zeek network security monitor
- **Use Case**: Baseline traffic analysis and connection pattern detection

### 2. Snort Alert Logs  
- **File**: `snort-alerts.log`
- **Format**: Multi-line text blocks
- **Content**: Security alerts and intrusion detection signatures
- **Use Case**: Known attack pattern recognition and alert correlation

### 3. PCAP Files
- **Files**: `normal-traffic.pcap`, `port-scan.pcap`, `suspicious-traffic.pcap`
- **Format**: Binary packet capture format
- **Content**: Raw network packets for deep inspection and analysis
- **Use Case**: Protocol analysis and packet-level anomaly detection

#### Generated PCAP Files:
- **normal-traffic.pcap**: Baseline HTTPS connections to legitimate websites
- **port-scan.pcap**: Network reconnaissance targeting common ports (21, 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, 135, 139, 443, 445, 993, 995, 1433, 3306, 3389)
- **suspicious-traffic.pcap**: High-frequency connection attempts simulating DDoS patterns

## üéØ Testing Scenarios

### Normal Traffic Patterns
- Regular DNS queries
- HTTP/HTTPS web browsing
- SSH administrative sessions
- Database connections

### Suspicious Activities
- Port scanning attempts
- Brute force login attempts
- Unusual data transfer patterns
- Command & control communications

### Known Attacks
- DDoS traffic patterns
- Malware communications
- Data exfiltration attempts
- Network reconnaissance

## üìä Expected Results

When processing this sample data, the SwarmID system should detect:
- **3-5 anomalies** from port scanning activities (port-scan.pcap)
- **2-3 alerts** from suspicious connection patterns (suspicious-traffic.pcap)
- **1-2 high-priority** security events requiring investigation
- **85-95% accuracy** in classification compared to ground truth
- **Normal traffic baseline** from legitimate HTTPS connections (normal-traffic.pcap)

## üõ†Ô∏è Generating New PCAP Files

To generate fresh PCAP sample files, you can run the included generator:

```powershell
cd sample-data
dotnet run
```

This will create three new PCAP files with realistic network traffic patterns for testing the SwarmID detection algorithms.

## üîß Usage Instructions

1. **Upload via Dashboard**: Use the web interface to upload log files
2. **API Integration**: POST files to `/api/traffic/analyze` endpoint
3. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple files simultaneously
4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Use for testing real-time detection capabilities

## üìà Performance Benchmarks

- **Processing Speed**: ~150ms per 1000 traffic records
- **Memory Usage**: ~50MB for typical log file (10MB)
- **Detection Latency**: <500ms for real-time analysis
- **Accuracy**: 90%+ for known attack patterns
